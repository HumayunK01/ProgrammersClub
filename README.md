# Programmers Club V1.0

## ⚠️ Project Archived – Version 2.0 Coming Soon!

Hello everyone 👋,

I want to let you know that development on **Version 1.0** of this project has officially been stopped.

Due to some unresolved critical errors and an unfortunate loss of important project files that cannot be recovered, I’ve decided to discontinue this version. I truly tried my best to fix the issues, but they kept getting worse over time and became too complex to handle within the current setup.

But here’s the good news — **Version 2.0** is on the way! 🚀  
The new version will be rebuilt from the ground up with improved structure, cleaner code, and better stability. Every challenge faced in this version is shaping the next one to be more robust and maintainable.

Thank you for your understanding and support. Stay tuned — exciting things are coming soon! 😊
